 Dev Note: 
  I really wanted to code my own portfolio website that utilized React and 3d materials. I learned a lot and hope to make more websites that look and feel more nice! Thank you for checking it out : )

  p.s thank you to the countless youtube tutorials and friends that helped me on the way
