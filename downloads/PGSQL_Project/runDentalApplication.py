# cancelSomeVisits (myConn, maxVisitCancellations :
# Besides the database connection, this Python function has one other parameter,
# maxVisitCancellations, which is an integer.
#
# cancelSomeVisits invokes a Stored Function, cancelSomeVisitsFunction, that you will need to
# implement and store in the database according to the description in Section 5.  The Stored
# Function cancelSomeVisitsFunction has all the same parameters as cancelSomeVisits (except
# for the database connection, which is not a parameter for the Stored Function), and it returns
# an integer.
#
# Section 5 of the Lab4 tells you which visits to cancel and explains the integer value
# that cancelSomeVisitsFunction returns.  The cancelSomeVisits Python function returns the
# the same integer value that the cancelSomeVisitsFunction Stored Function returns.
#
# cancelSomeVisitsFunction doesnâ€™t print anything.  The cancelSomeVisits function must only
# invoke the Stored Function cancelSomeVisitsFunction, which does all of the work for this part
# of the assignment; cancelSomeVisits should not do any of the work itself.

# For more details, see the Lab4 pdf.
